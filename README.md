# Website_with_Unity_and_PHP_Capstone_Project
 A Capstone Project that demonstrates teamwork, resulting in a website scheduler capable of registering root users, admin users, and scheduler users. This site was co-created with the help of Joseph Filipek. Joseph created all of the Unity functionality client-side and I created all of the PHP files server-side while assisting him in creating his own PHP files to connect to the database. PHP sessions are implemented to avoid bypassing the Login process and emails are sent to registered users telling them to wait for approval from the root user. A password generator is implemented to generate a random password for the root user consisting of 25 characters: 5 special characters, 10 numbers, and 10 alternating lower-case and upper-case letters. Passwords are hashed before being saved in the database and the password_verify() method is used when comparing a textfield password with a password in the database. A combination of PHP data objects and MySQLi extension are used when sending SQL statements to the database. Please note: The Unity files have not been bug proofed so there may be complications that still need to be worked out, however, Unity is a very complex game engine that wasn't built with web design in mind and by implementing this idea we showcase our ability to get creative while trying something not a lot of people have tried before.
